## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio was created for the **Portxfolio Hackathon on Devpost**. I’ve always dreamed of building a portfolio that not only showcases my skills but also tells my story with a personal and artistic touch.

When I saw this hackathon, I realized it was the perfect chance to **refurbish my old portfolio** into something more vibrant, inspiring, and uniquely me. I challenged myself to use **only raw HTML, CSS, and JS** — no frameworks — and design it with attention to detail, animation, and emotion.

The result is a **dreamy, animated portfolio** that reflects my passion, goals, and journey.
